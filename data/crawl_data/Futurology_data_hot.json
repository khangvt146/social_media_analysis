        "title": "Energy in an Incorporeal Society",
        "created_utc": 1729515341.0,
        "selftext": "\"Energy in an Incorporeal Society\" is an intriguing concept, blending ideas of energy systems with the notion of a society that lacks physical bodies, or exists in non-material form. Let's break down some ways this could be explored:\n\n# 1. Energy Redefined\n\nIn a society where beings are incorporeal, traditional forms of energy like food, fuel, and physical exertion may not apply. Instead, energy could be understood as:\n\n* **Cognitive or mental energy**: The ability to think, communicate, or interact with other incorporeal entities might draw from some internal or collective source of energy, perhaps similar to mental focus or concentration in physical humans.\n* **Emotional or psychic energy**: Beings might \"feed\" off emotional or psychological states, drawing energy from positive emotions like joy, creativity, or even intellectual satisfaction.\n* **Quantum or spiritual energy**: In more speculative scenarios, incorporeal entities might draw energy from metaphysical or quantum sources. This could include fields of energy that permeate the universe, allowing beings to sustain themselves without physical form.\n\n# 2. How Energy is Produced\n\n* **Mental Interaction and Collective Thought**: In such a society, collective thought or shared experiences might generate energy. Collaboration between incorporeal beings could form a kind of energy system, where consciousness contributes to a greater whole.\n* **Universal Energy Fields**: Incorporeal entities might tap into cosmic or quantum fields of energy that are omnipresent in the universe. These energy fields could be generated by natural phenomena (such as stars, black holes, or dark energy).\n* **Emotion as Fuel**: If emotion or thought serves as fuel, then energy could be produced through relationships, interactions, and shared experiences. Perhaps emotional bonds create stronger energy surges, and conflict drains energy, providing a natural regulatory balance in society.\n\n# 3. Energy Exchange in Society\n\n* **Telepathic Networks**: Beings in an incorporeal society could exchange energy through telepathy or direct mental connections, allowing for the free flow of ideas, emotions, and energy.\n* **Distributed Consciousness**: Energy may not reside in individuals at all, but could be a collective resource, accessible through shared consciousness. The society itself might function as a hive mind, with energy flowing wherever it's needed.\n* **Energy Scarcity and Abundance**: Even in an incorporeal state, there may be variations in energy access. Perhaps some entities are more adept at drawing energy from certain sources, leading to a hierarchy or economy based on energy manipulation skills.\n\n# 4. Technology in an Incorporeal Society\n\n* **Non-material Tech**: Technologies in such a society may not be physical machines but rather mental constructs, thought-forms, or energy patterns that serve various societal functions. These could manifest as tools for boosting energy, facilitating communication, or manipulating the environment (which may be more conceptual than physical).\n* **Energy Constructs**: Energy could be shaped into structures, tools, or environments by beings, creating a reality out of pure energy or thought. Instead of building homes or infrastructure, the society might \"think\" them into existence.\n* **Consciousness-Driven Energy Grids**: An energy grid in such a society could be a network of consciousnesses, with energy transferred based on need or consensus rather than physical infrastructure.\n\n# 5. Philosophical and Ethical Questions\n\n* **What is Life Without Matter?**: In an incorporeal society, life might be redefined. What does it mean to live, to thrive, to create when physical existence isn\u2019t a factor? How does individuality persist, if at all?\n* **Equality of Energy Access**: Who controls the energy in such a society? Does everyone have equal access to it, or is there a form of inequality based on one\u2019s mental or emotional capabilities?\n* **Energy Depletion or Immortality?**: Is energy finite in this world? Could beings run out of energy, leading to their dissolution, or is this a path to immortality? The potential for eternal existence or gradual energy decay raises questions about the lifecycle of incorporeal beings.\n\n# 6. Implications for Society and Culture\n\n* **Non-Physical Art and Creativity**: Creativity might be expressed in entirely non-physical ways, such as through shared mental experiences or energy constructs. Art could be created from thought, and shared telepathically.\n* **Justice and Ethics**: How would justice work in a society where actions are not physical? Would energy theft or the draining of psychic resources be considered a crime?\n* **Communication and Relationships**: Relationships might rely more on mental and emotional connections rather than physical proximity or interaction. Communication could be instant and deeply personal, blurring the lines between individuals.",

        "selftext": "Advanced brain machine interfaces create the possibility of instantaneous knowledge transfer from humanity to individuals, the most cliche example being Neo instantly mastering Kung Fu in the first Matrix film. \n\nFar beyond that example is the idea of not just mastering various arbitrary subject matter but digital superintelligence being available \"on tap\" to everyone, transforming the average person into something far beyond the level of brilliance attributed to history's most famous thinkers such as Einstein, DaVinci, etc. This future creates a great \"flattening\" of intelligence. It becomes as readily available as oxygen. \n\nSo what becomes of childhood? \n\nThe gap between those who undergo cybernetic modification and the vanishingly small percentage of people who do not for various heterodox social, political, religious and philosophical reasons will be so huge that the aforementioned minority will be akin to something like the Amish or the (mostly) \"uncontacted\" tribes still living in the Amazon. Such a choice could even be viewed by future generations as a form of child neglect or abuse, denying them access to such an evolutionary leap in capacity to learn and thrive in world of exponentially increasing complexity. \n\nSo to would become the gap between cybernetically modified humans **and their own children awaiting cyberization.**\n\nThis would potentially create a desire to have humans undergo cyberization at a very young age, perhaps at pre-school or kindergarten age. \n\nBut then what becomes of the entire concept of childhood, which we have traditionally thought of as this gradual process of learning and exploration of the external world? \n\nWithout some form of regulation, a five year old would have access to the same level of intelligence and knowledge as their parents. The stage of brain development would not necessarily be a limiting factor. \n\nSo do we allow for unfettered intellectual mastery at the youngest age (baby Einsteins) but leave emotional development alone? \n\nWhere are the lines drawn? What becomes of the whole concept of \"growing\" mentally as a child? \n\nIn the X-Men universe the children at Xavier's school gradually learn how to control and master their mutant powers. It is a process that takes some time and runs in parallel to their physical and emotional development. \n\nAdvanced cyberization will not be like this. It will allow for instant mastery. Of anything. Instant acquisition of godlike intelligence. \n\nAgain, what becomes of childhood? ",

        "selftext": "A vision for an incorporeal society could center on the idea of transcending material dependencies and fostering a deeper connection to the essence of existence. In this society, people prioritize the immaterial aspects of life\u2014like consciousness, experiences, and relationships\u2014over physical possessions and survival-driven instincts.\n\nKey aspects might include:\n\n\t1.\tTransformation of Values: People in an incorporeal society shift their focus from accumulating wealth, status, or physical security to enhancing the quality of consciousness. Growth would be measured by personal and collective evolution in understanding, creativity, and emotional depth.\n\t2.\tTechnological Integration: Advanced technologies would facilitate greater freedom from the limitations of the physical body. For instance, augmented reality, mind-uploading, or consciousness-expansion tools could allow people to experience life beyond the constraints of their physical forms.\n\t3.\tSocial Structures: Communities would be structured around collaboration rather than competition. Without the need to preserve physical life at all costs, social systems would emphasize shared experiences, knowledge exchange, and spiritual growth. This could manifest in decentralized, flexible living arrangements where fluid identity and movement replace traditional societal norms.\n\t4.\tEnvironmental Harmony: With a reduced emphasis on material consumption, such a society would naturally align with sustainability. Energy use, waste production, and environmental footprints would shrink dramatically, as people no longer rely on physical goods or excessive resource extraction.\n\t5.\tEthical Evolution: Morality in an incorporeal society would revolve around enhancing consciousness and minimizing harm. Life-enhancing technologies or spiritual practices would be designed to uplift collective well-being, encouraging a fluid sense of self rather than clinging to rigid, ego-driven behaviors.\n\t6.\tArt, Knowledge, and Exploration: Artistic expression, philosophical inquiry, and the pursuit of wisdom would become central pursuits. As people explore higher states of consciousness, creativity would flourish, driven by the desire to push the boundaries of perception and understanding.\n\nThis vision presents a future where human evolution is shaped by an incorporeal ideal, freeing society from physical constraints to focus on expanding collective consciousness and shared experiences.",

Before you downvote me and move on, please hear my experience with AI content in the last month\n\n1. Meshy - This tool can generate realistic/cartoon/anime looking 3d models that are mid to decent. It was garbage 3 months ago\n\n2. Invidio - Generate edited video content that is better than 50-60% of youtube content currently present. Combine that with Dreamlabs stuff and you get quite a bit of mileage \n\n3. Udio -This can generate decent to pretty good music now that many channels have started posting copyrighted AI music that gets lots of likes even\n\n4. Elvenlabs - This can generate TTS that is better than 60-70% of voice actors I have seen in games and dubbed anime. You can generate a femme fatale uber secsy voice that can put ptoper inflections and emphasis on words and make your ears pregnant.\n\n5. GPT/Copilot - Right now, they can generate mid to servicable code that some companies are already replacing 20-30% of their employees with tools like this\n\n6. Midjourney/Dall-E - They can generate a wide array of images across various genre that are low to mid right now but gradually improving. You don't see a lot of 2 left feet or 6 fingered people anymore and they are starting to solve captcha\n\n7. Gemini/Bard - Yeah yeah pretty awful right now as standalone tools but with proper prompts and bouncing ideas, they can generate mid to decent content. Their translation ability far outpaces human translator though and I would say its excellent if not nearly perfect for medium chunks of text\n\n8. Bots \n\nNow what I am worried is, once these tools get a little more advanced, you should theoretically be able to combine them to pump out infinite amount of content - like say games or youtube videos. Imagine a workflow that can generate 1 slop game per day or 25 videos daily. Steam and youtube would get flooded with slop content. Even our industrial processes would go down an unpredictable route. \n\nWhat then? Or am I just delusional? I haven't even started on other stuff like character ai or ai pron generators...",

        "created_utc": 1729348133.0,
        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently came across a few posts about AI assistants and it got me thinking. Would people actually want a\u00a0*real*\u00a0AI assistant, and what would you even want it to do? I\u2019m not talking about Siri or Alexa, but something way more advanced, like literally a personal AI assistant that can handle everything in your life, from managing your schedule, handling all communications, organizing your groceries, predicting tasks, even being your travel agent, ordering food, Ubers, all built around a conversational AI assistant.\n\nIt got me thinking about the current state of AI as a whole, and if we're far from this or not. Is this something people would even want? There are a lot of ethical concerns around it I think, including basically giving whatever this system would be access to all your private and confidential information, which would essentially be used as training data, etc, etc.\n\nSo I guess my question is:\n\n1. How far do you think we are from something like that becoming reality? We\u2019ve seen some pretty cool advances in AI tech over the past few years, but are we really close to having a fully integrated, proactive AI that\u00a0*understands*\u00a0us like a personal assistant would?\n2. Is this something you think you would use, or people as a whole would rally around? What features would it have to have for it to be worth using for you.\n\nI know for me I always loved the idea of everything I do being automated around being 'conversational'. What I mean is, if I ask an assistant to find me flights to from LAX to NYC on United, and a Hilton Hotel < $300/night in Times Square for example, just me asking that should be enough to send me results to my email or something. Or I should just be able to say 'Book a reservation for 2 people at Bob's Italian Restaurant for 7pm on Saturday', and it would just do it. That's I guess what it would be for me.\n\nWould love to start a discussion here.",

Maybe if deployed and implemented well - AI strengthened democracy?\n\n\nThe [study from DeepMind](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq2852) in Britain shows AI can mediate between opposing groups successfully. By independently summarizing their viewpoints, researchers found by using AI they reached common ground and agreed more, than without using the AI.\n\n\nI think another unexplored way AI may strengthen democracy is by using it to teach critical thinking skills.

        "created_utc": 1729181404.0,
        "selftext": "The [research in question](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/observation-of-significant-photosynthesis-in-garden-cress-and-cyanobacteria-under-simulated-illumination-from-a-k-dwarf-star/18E1D525821108801DBCB99515EBF318) grew a common plant - garden cress, and a cyanobacteria under a simulated K dwarf light spectrum. This has never been tested before, somewhat surprisingly, the garden cress grew as normally as it would from our G-type star's sunlight, but the cyanobacteria grew even better. \n\nPanspermia is the idea that life throughout the universe is seeded from elsewhere. We can easily see the mechanism for this in our own solar system. Asteroid ejecta from Mars has made its way to Earth many times. We can assume the opposite has happened with Earth's material traveling throughout our solar system. Indeed, if we found life on Mars or Europa, the first question would be if it arose independently or was seeded via Panspermia. \n\nThis discovery bolsters the idea that the same thing is happening throughout the galaxy. It would be harder for such asteroid ejecta to escape the gravitational pull of its local solar system, but it does happen. Thus dust from other planets outside the solar system reaches our Earth, and we can assume vice versa. \n\nThis is why this discovery is so intriguing. K-type stars are common, making up 12% of all stars. Not only that, they are unusually long-lived and stable. Gliese 86, a K-type star that is 35 light years from us, is 10 billion years old, more than twice the age of our own solar system.  \n\nIf cyanobacteria perform better under a K-type star's light - did they originally evolve there?\n\nIt is possible we are operating under completely incorrect assumptions, both about the origin of life on our own planet, and the search for life on others. Most research into the origin of life here assumes it arose independently. Perhaps, it is much more reasonable to think Panspermia is the most likely explanation. \n\nSecondly, the search for extraterrestrial life assumes we are looking for something that arose independently elsewhere. Perhaps, that is wrong too. Maybe it is more reasonable to think microbial life is common everywhere in the universe but primarily has spread by Panspermia, with who knows how few times it has arisen independently.",

Furthermore, with the rapid advancements that AGI could enable, do you think we could approach longevity escape velocity where innovations in health and longevity continuously extend our lifespan?\n\n  \nI believe that if we will have AGI in 2035 , i will be very surprised if we will not reach LEV  until 2060.\n\nP.S Also is there a possibility that no matter if we achieve AGI  and ASI even with them we will never be able to reverse our aging cause its impossible ?

I am asking you to imagine its 2050 and mars is somehow habitable, now in the process of colonising it and settling the first actual group of people there (not just scientists and researchers), what do you think would be the problems faced by let say administrators of the mars who are implementing this transfer. I want you guys to focus on issues with implementation and then think what would be the type of poeple going their, their personas, goals, motivations, etc. And the problems faced apart from making planet habitable. (focus on the human part, not the science part ).\nLike one issue could be deciding who gets to go mars.\n\n\nEdit: \n\nClarifications: I am not telling you to completely disregard technical aspect, but do not need to know why its a bad idea to settle on mars, but rather of if we are settling on it what kind of tech you can expect to see which makes it possible and the problems associated with it",

        "created_utc": 1729067249.0,
        "selftext": "I like the idea of personal rapid transit (PRT) replacing cars in cities and suburbs. In case you don't know what PRT is, it's a mode of public transportation in which small automated vehicles with a capacity of four to six people travel on specially built guideways. It can transport people to their destination without making intermediate stops so PRT is faster than a bus, light rail or subway. There have already been a few personal rapid transit systems in service. Among them is the Heathrow pods in London Heathrow Airport. These links should provide you more information.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal\\_rapid\\_transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_rapid_transit)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2009/11/26/120590726/personal-rapid-transit-future-or-elevated-fantasy#:\\~:text=The%20promise%20of%20personal%20rapid,and%20zippy%2C%20like%20Smart%20cars](https://www.npr.org/2009/11/26/120590726/personal-rapid-transit-future-or-elevated-fantasy#:~:text=The%20promise%20of%20personal%20rapid,and%20zippy%2C%20like%20Smart%20cars)\n\n[https://paleofuture.com/blog/2014/1/30/people-movers-were-the-great-transportation-promise-of-the-1970s](https://paleofuture.com/blog/2014/1/30/people-movers-were-the-great-transportation-promise-of-the-1970s)\n\n[https://www.govtech.com/transportation/personal-rapid-transit-revival.html](https://www.govtech.com/transportation/personal-rapid-transit-revival.html)\n\nSince PRT vehicles are powered solely by electricity, they produce very little noise and emit no emissions. Therefore, it would reduce air pollution and noise pollution, especially when electricity is supplied by renewable sources of energy. It would allow people to ditch their cars and reduce emissions in an effort to mitigate climate change.\n\nAlso, it is cheaper to build a PRT system than light rail or subway since PRT vehicles have a low weight and the guideways are narrow. Traffic congestion would be alleviated as PRT is computer controlled and the guideways are isolated from roads. Parking is unnecessary as one PRT vehicle can be shared by multiple users. Its benefits would improve the quality of urban life and make cities safer. Do you think it would happen? If so, when?",

        "created_utc": 1729014060.0,
        "selftext": "Greetings and salutations to fellow future thinking people and lost souls pretending to be so.\n\n  \nFirst on the agenda for this discussion - this subject matter has been trashed and dragged through the mud most recently in the media and sparked the most debates, AI and autonomous driving systems witnin the context of Tesla's latest announcement regarding their future dedicated automous taxi vehicle, so dubbed robocab or robotaxi, nomenclature aside....that one.\n\n  \nWhat are autonomous cars even being developed for, many so far uninterested in this tech might ask themselves? Autonomous cars are meant to solve several problems for transportation and even urban planning. First and foremost, when they reach the required capability they will vastly reduce deaths due to car accidents. Without a doubt nobody will try to debate why this is an undesirable development, but want to know more why and other advantages of such vehicles. Well humans are flawed, many accidents happen due to driver error, humans can get distracted, sick but insist on driving, drunk, high on drugs and medication, they can experience fainting or sudden bouts of fatigue, strokes, etc. and cause an accident. By removing the human component, all accidents related to failures of humans be it their behavior like rekless driving all the way due to failures of their very bodies due to various conditions. Second major advantage self driving cars is that they promise to reduce the overall number of cars sold per year or being driven on the road thus having knock on effects in reducing pollution both from production of new cars as well as pollution due to disposing a larger number of cars in circulation that periodically need to be trashed. Why? Because most cars sit idle parked instead of being used for what it was produced for in the first place, to move people or cargo. Automous cars will be operational and on the road most of time so a single vehicle could replace several cars driven by humans and move the same number of people or cargo in a day. Speaking of parking, with the previously mentioned consequence by self driving cars, of reducing the need for the same number of cars in a given economy, it reduces the number of parking spots required. While this is not important or thought about by most people, those who do urban planning know how much space, resources and inefficiencies parking spots create in cities, all those parking spots could either be returned to pedestrians or used for buildings and thus bring homes, hospitals, shops, office buildings, schools, etc. closer to each other making the time and cost to move between them cheaper and shorter. It could also be used to create more green zones like parks.\n\n  \nTl:dr 1: Why are autonomous vehicles desirable? Because they reduce the number of cars on the road, reduce pollution, improve urban planning and increase green zones in large cities.\n\n  \nWith the cursive explanation as to why such cars exist and the associate technology being developed, let's focus on the how to accomplish it, a brief history with videos from past research and products up to today. Without a shadow of the doubt autonomous vehicles, self driving cars, whatever they are called have not achieved the level of capability and safety as of yet to enable the above mentioned reasons why they should or ought to be pursued for mass adoption. To continue this discussion I should mention the way in which autonomy is categorized in levels from 0 to 5. These links should help clarify\n\n  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving\\_car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car)\n\n  \n[https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016\\_202104/](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_202104/)\n\n\n\nA brief history of autonomous systems in the past decades. The interest in self driving system reignited at least in the academic sphere, making abstraction of semi autonomous ones used in niche applications like factories, around the time DARPA challenge. Here's a video documenting one of these events from 2005.\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/7a6GrKqOxeU?si=TNOq67STUZRhZxVb](https://youtu.be/7a6GrKqOxeU?si=TNOq67STUZRhZxVb)\n\n  \nFor road going vehicles the first major adoptor and seller of autonomous driving cars with level 2 autonomy was Tesla with the Autopilot system first developed with the help of Mobileye and introduced to the public by the middle of the 2010s.\n\n  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobileye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobileye)\n\n\n\n[https://youtu.be/tH1ipC4MBZ0?si=3Q8\\_UVWW6sUe4C6I](https://youtu.be/tH1ipC4MBZ0?si=3Q8_UVWW6sUe4C6I)\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/z4Nkovbrnx8?si=Kbsko0VJjkK7IJMe](https://youtu.be/z4Nkovbrnx8?si=Kbsko0VJjkK7IJMe)\n\n  \nOne notable example that should be mentioned are protypes of test vehicles developed by the likes of Google, an excerpt from 2012\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/cdgQpa1pUUE?si=\\_C0Vgqa88paN0KM9](https://youtu.be/cdgQpa1pUUE?si=_C0Vgqa88paN0KM9)\n\n  \nRegardless of various previous attempts, Tesla's Autopilot was ultimately the one that gained the most adoption initially and spurred other companies into developing and putting into production other competing level 2 systems. After a break up with Mobileye, Tesla chose to develop their own software initially running on nVidia chips and later on their own developed and custom made chips with a slew of sensor revisions and upgrade along the way. As of 2024, their commercially available solution remains at level 2 autonomy.\n\n  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\\_Autopilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot)\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/lajDCnVG7vQ?si=CO1WG8kk-Vfez80m](https://youtu.be/lajDCnVG7vQ?si=CO1WG8kk-Vfez80m)\n\n  \nIn the interim between the early road tests of self driving cars and today various projects appeared, some with less or more funding for cars with higher level of autonomy that were not pursuing immediate commercial use, but to develop and test vehicles in the real world and improve the systems up to the point where they are proven safe and sufficiently advanced to enter commercial use. One notable example being Waymo which traces its origins to the aforemention Darpa challenge, its founding members having had competed at that time and were seeking to bring their solution to a commercial ready state. This company was started in 2009 and was a continuation of the Google self driving car prject mentioned above. \n\n  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo)\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/ArYTxDZzQOM?si=-R2M5dRtscZH9sal](https://youtu.be/ArYTxDZzQOM?si=-R2M5dRtscZH9sal)\n\n  \nThis is their recent version being tested on public roads\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/tgX7yzyfQ6E?si=uY0GrsG0T7UgNgfD](https://youtu.be/tgX7yzyfQ6E?si=uY0GrsG0T7UgNgfD)\n\n  \nNaturally as these more famous and publicized projects or products were being commercialized and tested, all over the world there were different companies trying to compete on either developing more affordable and capable level 2 systems for immediate use on mass market cars or level 5 autonomous vehicles for a more distant goal of higher autonomy which would eventually be sold either directly or licensed to third parties. Notable examples being, among others Baidu developed self driving taxi in China.\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/dtRwMh7dbf4?si=Js6R7Nf81aEcra1Z](https://youtu.be/dtRwMh7dbf4?si=Js6R7Nf81aEcra1Z)\n\n  \nConcluding this recent and shallow history lesson with many omissions of other level 2 systems being introduced in the past 7 years, the point I'm making and should be self evident is that since the mid 2000s of Darpa prototypes to the mid 2010s of the first commercially available level 2 systems and continuing to the limited public road testing up to today of level 5 systems, it's obvious the technology has improved dramatically. While it's still unclear if level 5 systems will be good enough soon to start mass scale production and use on public roads to finally realize the benefits of such cars for citizens and cities alike, progress has been consistent and tangible. Which brings me to the criticism of Tesla unveiling their level 5 concepts and prototypes. None of them hold any weight, Tesla is not pursuing autonomy due to a feavor dream of their lunatic CEO, it was a long time coming, lots of wins were had along the way but it's certainly not mission accomplished. I cannot stress enough that level 5 systems are not ready but Tesla developing their own is not only expected but a no brainer. As to them reaping a profit this decade, the next or three decades from now it's irrelevant to us as observers or potential clients. As people who would like to predict the future it's certainly worth debating when but neven justified debating IF it will happen with the evidence I provided above. Improvements are clear and cannot be denied. It would be almost impossible for a new company now starting development to claim they will be one of the major leaders when the tech is ready because they would lack the resources and infrastructure to mass produced them even if they had a few working prototypes. Why are journalists, Tesla stock speculators or their CEO's long time haters being given any spot at the table to 1. Educate people on the subject. 2. Make any credible prediction when they know so little about it, not even on my level of just following developments over 2 decades with leisurely, luke warm focus?\n\n\n\nSecond on the agenda and I will be brief here are the criticisms and skepticism of, once again, Tesla's bipedal robot. I will provide a brief history and notable advancements and specifically a timeline of Tesla's own achievements with said robot protptypes and remaining challenges.\n\n  \nHumanoid robots walking on two legs unassisted has been in development for a long time but no major milestones were achieved until relatively recently. A well known project was Honda (surprise a car maker)'s Asimo robot which began development in the 1980s\n\n  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIMO)\n\n  \nTheir progress was fairly remarkable up to when the prototype advanced to the one known today in this form, but lacking major technological advancement in terms of computation and robot locomotion it never pursuied a mass market solution.\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/1V9XUMCPGF8?si=gP2NWf6AXZ6HoVE0](https://youtu.be/1V9XUMCPGF8?si=gP2NWf6AXZ6HoVE0)\n\n  \nParallel to this in the US, a little known company called Boston Dynamics with members originating from MIT and  pursued their own goals in developing advanced robots which eventually culminated in the Spot quadruped and Atlas bipedal robot that are more well known today. Less known is their arduous path to creating anything remotely competent in the mid to late 2010s.\n\n  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston\\_Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Dynamics)\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/Bd5iEke6UlE?si=AALkT37syiX1sZyu](https://youtu.be/Bd5iEke6UlE?si=AALkT37syiX1sZyu)\n\n  \nThe company emerged to prominence at least outside academic communities with the Darpa robotic challenge, again a defense project stirred up a renewed interest in bipedal robots in early 2010s\n\n  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA\\_Robotics\\_Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Robotics_Challenge)\n\n  \nBefore Atlas, there was Petman\n\n[https://youtu.be/g0TaYhjpOfo?si=OP30YF103vnYlJls](https://youtu.be/g0TaYhjpOfo?si=OP30YF103vnYlJls)\n\n\n\nPlease keep that in mid before I go down memory lane for Tesla's own humanoid robot project. It took them 20 years to make Petman and another couple of years to get to this level in 2016\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/rVlhMGQgDkY?si=Qoar43NOpi3Y0Cyk](https://youtu.be/rVlhMGQgDkY?si=Qoar43NOpi3Y0Cyk)\n\n  \nAs of now their most advanced prototype was this recent unveiled version\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/29ECwExc-\\_M?si=aK-Qc4sael2NQAph](https://youtu.be/29ECwExc-_M?si=aK-Qc4sael2NQAph)\n\n  \nOnce again, from the first jumping and crawling robots to the 2016 Atlas it too circa 25 years plus or minus and another 8 years to the current itteration. Without a doubt everyone would recognize that the pace of advancement not only has accelerated but, just like with autonomous cars, their commercial use is much closer now than in the past. Ofc Honda and Boston Dynamics were not the only one, while they were hard at work others were trying to catch up and overtake them, such as Agility Robotics or Unitree Robotics and many more,\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/CVcfNBYBYqA?si=DSb6qLudZXbq7eK6](https://youtu.be/CVcfNBYBYqA?si=DSb6qLudZXbq7eK6)\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/GtPs\\_ygfaEA?si=Smq5HSvFJN35GxAD](https://youtu.be/GtPs_ygfaEA?si=Smq5HSvFJN35GxAD)\n\n  \nHeck at some point some other rich person was pouring his money into this gundam\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/3ldJswGpkjY?si=65BXOT2i3VFJn0QV](https://youtu.be/3ldJswGpkjY?si=65BXOT2i3VFJn0QV)\n\n  \nHere comes Tesla announcing their intention to start developing a bipedal robot in 2022, at the time they had no working prototype, just an idea as to why to make it and how it might look like a function, without a doubt they had only a presentation and bits of parts from their cars they were wondering how to adapt and modify to make Optimus, their own branded bipedal robot. \n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/wnt31K-14yQ?si=xnvM-XbPHz15LU0\\_](https://youtu.be/wnt31K-14yQ?si=xnvM-XbPHz15LU0_)\n\n  \nLet me say it again, they officially unveiled their plans in 2022 and had made so little progress, because likely they had just started the development, that there was no working prototype to show off standing on it's own, walking, using its arms under it's own powered and without a tether to grasp and manipulate items, absolutely no clue how to do it either, just the need and want. By now you might be wondering why bipedal robots are a desirable product like autonomous cars? What problems do they promise to solve? For people that think a lot about the future that question is dumb since the answer is everything and anything a human might do but now at the cost of raw materials and energy. So the problem they solve? Infinite cheap labor, provided it's advanced enough in locomotion and intelligence to accomplish task autonomously and learn how to do and master those task with ease. Suffice to say we are not there yet, just like with self driving cars, but just like with self driving cars it should be obvious major milestones were achieved and it's a lot closer to technological capability to the end goals than the public realizes.\n\n  \nBack to Tesla, in late 2023 they managed to advance in their protypes enough to demonstrate locomotion and hand manipulation of small objects with fine control\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/cpraXaw7dyc?si=e9EzDZKGwWDOmgbe](https://youtu.be/cpraXaw7dyc?si=e9EzDZKGwWDOmgbe)\n\n  \nIn case you didn't do the math, it took them barely a year to go from nothing to a walking and hand, arm capabilities to manipulate objects. A fucking year. Not 26 + 8 like Boston Dynamics, a fucking year. On the second year they managed to increase their locomotion and object manipulation capabilities enough to do the presentation at the We robot unveiling recently.\n\n  \nWhat did the media and influencers communicate to the public? Oh, it didn't have onboard natural language capabilities and were controled remotely to hand over goodies to atendees or play rock paper scissors with them. That was the message communicated to the public and pervading the discussion in this very sub. What is the reality however? None of that matters, onboard computing power is already maxed out for keeping the robots upright and walking through the environment or doing camera to hand coordination to manipulate objects. Does no one imagine they could put an Alexa type device connected to through the wi fi to a supercomputer ran ChatGPT like AI to do the talking? Was that the key major take away for 2 years of lightning fast development from nuts and bolts to likely the most feature complete bipedal robot right now? While Optimus might not have the most advanced locomotion it's certainly competitive and human like but the most striking part about it is that it's excellent at everything including object manipulation, you know the stuff it's needed to do work? If we're talking about commercial use Boston Dynamics and others are now far behind in being feature complete to Tesla when two years ago all of this was yet another, according to the general message right now, a feaver dream of an unstable CEO.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the narrative right now is not only overly skeptical but down right ignorant. I urge anyone to check out thunderfoot video, a well known skeptic of all things Tesla, from right after the Optimus project was unveiled in 2022 and how he \"debunks\" it just like everyone is debunking their level 5 autonomous car and bipedal robot now in 2024\n\n  \n[https://youtu.be/rmkFrv80b7Y?si=bCTbvrRMudfOkMjI](https://youtu.be/rmkFrv80b7Y?si=bCTbvrRMudfOkMjI)\n\n  \nIf you have an opinion but never cared about the tech and followed it, don't pretend to be able to make any judgements, let alone predictions of how and when these two technologies will be ready for mass adoption.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "# How we will view social media in the future and why the law has not kept up with technology.\n\nSocial media is a solid part of our daily lives. We scroll through feeds, like posts, share our lives, grow businesses, get inspiration and ideas. Yet, it is a relatively new thing.\n\nWhere does that comparison from the title come from?\n\n# Do we know the danger?\n\nImagine yourself in the 50s. Do you smoke? Most likely. Why did you start? Because everyone else does, because it\u2019s not harmful, because that helps you to keep social.\n\nJust like cigarettes back then, social media today is seen as a cool everyday thing. They connect us with loved (and not so loved) ones around the world, offer (literally) endless entertainment and provide a chance to turn your life around with a single viral.\n\nBut beneath the shiny surface, potential downsides are starting to bubble up, much like the health risks that eventually became undeniable with cigarettes.\n\nI know that some profiles and posts may make you feel that way, but it\u2019s unlikely to get cancer from scrolling TikTok.\n\nCigarettes' harm was primarily physical, sometimes taking years to reveal itself. We often just don\u2019t care until consequences are here, visible. That works with good things too and that\u2019s not a very good thing in itself.\n\nSocial media's impact, however, might be more subtle, even insidious. Cigarettes are physically harmful but can be psychologically good. On the other hand, social media is psychologically damaging, but most of the time it does not cause physical harm.\n\n**Specifics:**\n\n* **Mental Health:**\u00a0Studies suggest a correlation between heavy social media use and increased rates of anxiety and depression. Why? Comparison is starring here, see the article linked below.\n* **Attention Span and Focus:**\u00a0The rapid-fire nature of social media, with its constant notifications and short bursts of information, might be rewiring our brains for shorter attention spans and making it harder to focus on complex tasks.\n* **Addiction and Compulsive Behavior:**\u00a0Social media platforms are designed to be addictive, using algorithms to keep us scrolling for quick dopamine hits. Did you find yourself doomscrolling recently? I did.\n* **Privacy Concerns and Data Security:**\u00a0As we share more and more information about ourselves online, questions arise about privacy and data security. Who owns this data? How is it being used? Are we putting ourselves at risk of identity theft or manipulation? Keep in mind that companies are after profit, more than anything.\u00a0Louis Rossmann\u2019s\u00a0channel here, which is currently my favorite to watch while eating.\n* **Misinformation and Information Bubbles:**\u00a0Social media algorithms can create echo chambers, where we're primarily exposed to information that confirms our existing beliefs. Add confirmation effect to this and we got people believing the earth is flat.\n\n# But, why did nobody know the danger?\n\nBig companies lobbying. Good thing technological companies aren\u2019t as big as Tobacco in the 50s.",

        "created_utc": 1728792273.0,
        "selftext": "Currently, the only reason people doubt GPT from becoming AGI is that they doubt its general reasoning abilities, arguing its simply just memorising. It appears intelligent because simply, it's been trained on almost all data on the web, so almost every scenario is in distribution. This is a hard point to argue against, considering that GPT fails quite miserably at the arc-AGI challenge, a puzzle made so it can not be memorised. I believed they might have been right, that is until I read this paper ([\\[2410.02536\\] Intelligence at the Edge of Chaos (arxiv.org)](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2410.02536)).\n\nNow, in short, what they did is train a GPT-2 model on automata data. Automata's are like little rule-based cells that interact with each other. Although their rules are simple, they create complex behavior over time. They found that automata with low complexity did not teach the GPT model much, as there was not a lot to be predicted. If the complexity was too high, there was just pure chaos, and prediction became impossible again. It was this sweet spot of complexity that they call 'the Edge of Chaos', which made learning possible. Now, this is not the interesting part of the paper for my argument. What is the really interesting part is that learning to predict these automata systems helped GPT-2 with reasoning and playing chess.\n\nThink about this for a second: They learned from automata and got better at chess, something completely unrelated to automata. IF all they did was memorize, then memorizing automata states would help them not a single bit with chess or reasoning. But if they learned reasoning from watching the automata, reasoning that is so general it is transferable to other domains, it could explain why they got better at chess. \n\nNow, this is HUGE as it shows that GPT is capable of acquiring general intelligence from data. This means that they don't just memorize. They actually understand in a way that increases their overall intelligence. Since the only thing we currently can do better than AI is reason and understand, it is not hard to see that they will surpass us as they gain more compute and thus more of this general intelligence. \n\nNow, what I'm saying is not that generalisation and reasoning is the main pathway through which LLMs learn. I believe that, although they have the ability to learn to reason from data, they often prefer to just memorize since its just more efficient. They've seen a lot of data, and they are not forced to reason (before o1). This is why they perform horribly on arc-AGI (although they don't score 0, showing their small but present reasoning abilities). ",

These are homes which, as the name implies, are rounded domes in shape which have no flat surfaces.\n\nThe reason why this shape is important is wind catches on flat surfaces. So roof edges and the flat sides of homes become surfaces for harsh winds to catch and rip apart.\n\nDomed homes don't have this problem. Because the house is round in shape, the wind naturally wraps around the surface. It helps limit direct wind force damage to a home due to the more aerodynamic design.\n\nExamples of domed home designs:\n\n* [Example](https://media.wired.com/photos/59324e392a990b06268a9b1c/master/pass/domed-houses-ft.jpg) - Large wavy complex built low into the ground.\n* [Example](https://6amcity.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d5c78c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/969x545+1+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-sixam-city.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2F69%2F88d8cec236d68f1ba55777e9461a%2Fwp-verson-img-7995-copy.jpeg) - Large concrete structures\n* [Example](https://www.the-self-build-guide.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/400-1.jpg) - More traditional wood cabins\n* [Example](https://www.monolithic.org/vault/img/2011/05/10/4dc92b4fc29e0684730007a9/medium/1homes.jpg) - Bright white domes shrouded in greenery\n\nCoastal communities need to start taking these seriously. The reality is insurance companies will not be willing to sign off on plans for conventional homes anymore. The risk to more regular hurricanes prevents that.\n\n[Here's a video from 12 years ago where they interview a man who lives in a domed home.](https://youtu.be/jxsSBHTFk3w) He has lived through 9 hurricanes in his home and every house in his neighborhood has been replaced EXCEPT for his. \n\nThese homes really are the only option if people want to continue living on the coast. It's that or accept needing to rebuild every few years.",

        "title": "Are AML Regulations Turning Crypto into Government-Controlled Assets?",
        "created_utc": 1728434671.0,
        "selftext": "I've been thinking a lot about how [Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations](https://www.reddit.com/r/blockchainfinance/comments/1fzbqe4/insider_tips_on_aml_systems_at_centralized/) are messing with the crypto world, and honestly, it's starting to feel like cryptocurrencies are becoming government-controlled assets. The whole point of crypto was to have a decentralized system where we could transact without middlemen or excessive oversight, right?\n\nBut with these AML laws, we're seeing increased surveillance and control over what we do with our crypto. Exchanges are now required to collect tons of personal info, which not only kills our privacy but also creates huge databases that could get hacked or abused. It's like we're moving back towards the same centralized systems we were trying to avoid.\n\nPlus, smaller projects and startups in the crypto space are getting hit hard. They might not have the resources to comply with all these regulations, which means less innovation and more power to the big players who can afford to jump through all the hoops.\n\nAnd let's be real, while stopping illegal activities is important, these regulations often end up affecting regular users more than actual criminals. It feels like an overreach that's stifling the growth and potential of crypto.\n\nI'm worried that if this continues, we'll lose the decentralized and open nature of cryptocurrencies, turning them into just another extension of traditional financial systems controlled by governments.\n\nWhat do you all think? Are AML regulations going too far and hindering crypto's future? How can we balance the need for security with the principles of decentralization and privacy that make crypto so revolutionary?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",

        "selftext": "I have set up a philosophy podcast! It was far easier than I thought it would be. Each episode is a chat about an article from the SEP \u2014 The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Hence the title, ChatSEP. I believe that this will be the primary podcast that I listen to for the next year. It really makes concrete the possible future where everyone makes their own bespoke entertainment.\n\nHere is a link: [https://open.spotify.com/show/2pUm5OK4sG8RzDDcXUhOvQ?si=979e18a49090472d](https://open.spotify.com/show/2pUm5OK4sG8RzDDcXUhOvQ?si=979e18a49090472d)\n\nAnd to the SEP article: [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/)\n\nI am releasing 7 ten-minute episodes per day and will thereby cover all of the 1803 SEP articles in about 9 months. So far the episodes are about philosophy of religion, medieval philosophy, and most recently a series on Descartes.\u00a0 Later episodes will be about philosophy of science, logic, aethetics, ethics, Kant, Plato... literally every topic in philosophy. [Here is a random SEP article.](https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/random)\n\nI have already generated all of the content (350 hours, 60Gb) using [Google\u2019s NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/). After automating the procedure it took only 2 minutes to generate each episode, so 60 hours total. It then also takes about 2 minutes to schedule each episode to appear on Spotify. (I am doing this manually atm). Of course, I shouldn't take any intellectual or artistic credit for these things myself. The human effort that went into this project is as follows:\n\n1. scraping links to all the SEP articles,\n2. writing up a paste-in source to give it authorship information (this doesn't appear on the SEP article itself).\n3. scraping which article reference each other,\n4. coding up a nice walk through this graph (i.e., the episode order),\n5. automating the content generation,\n6. manually scheduling the episodes.\n\nI find two things crazy. Firstly, the quality of these episodes. Secondly, how one man in the course of a week can generate a years worth of podcast content. As I noted above, I believe that this will be the primary podcast that I listen to for the next year. It really makes concrete the possible future where everyone makes their own bespoke entertainment. And right now is the worst that this tech will ever be. Crazy!",

We are already starting to see that with drones. In the future, they will start to manufacture humanoid or sorta humanoid fighting robot that can shoot and attack and some gamer who has been playing a shooting game in their mom's room will be much more equipped to handle that with some training compared to veteran military personnel. I dont know how they do it now but someone who has alot of experience playing video games, particularly the ones where you fly helicopter and shoot will be much more equipped to handle drones than those who dont.\n\nAt even further point that may also be replaced by AI but in the closer future, I see scope of gaming in the military.\n\nIf you feel like wasting time playing these types of games, you are actually, atleast for our time.

This technology performs tasks that previously took skilled professionals many hours to complete in an instant.\n\nThe 3D modeling sector employs more people than one might expect, with the video game industry generating more revenue than Hollywood's movies and TV combined.\n\nSoon large numbers of these human 3D employees won't be needed anymore. The optimistic view suggests that AI will enhance human productivity, creating new markets and increasing demand for 3D products, thereby preserving jobs.\n\nConversely, the pessimistic perspective highlights the ongoing decline in real incomes in Western countries, making it unlikely that consumers can support these emerging markets.\n\nThus the more likely outcome will be that firms that can cut the most human jobs, and replace them with AI, will be the most competitive and survive. Not only that, this downward economic spiral will make it even harder for consumers to support other new markets for other humans laid off by AI and robotics.\n\nMost of our governments, politicians, and economists in positions of responsibility, firmly believe in the optimistic scenario.

It sounds great on paper: more food, fewer resources, and less labor, right? But I keep wondering, is this really going to fix the bigger problems?\n\nFor example, world hunger isn\u2019t just about not growing enough food. There\u2019s a whole mess of issues like how food gets distributed, trade politics, and even climate change that tech alone won\u2019t solve. Plus, what happens to all the people who work in farming, especially in poorer regions? If machines take over, where does that leave them?\n\nI\u2019m all for tech innovations, but I can\u2019t help but feel like we might be focusing on the shiny new tools without addressing the root causes of hunger. Are we just slapping a band-aid on a broken system? What do you all think\u2014are we missing the bigger picture here?",

But I also see where the mandate is different for big trucks (semis etc) that in California anyway they will require that half be electric sooo this means that diesel will still be needed (going to be difficult to ever get around pulling heavy loads long distances without it) so that might help keep gas stations alive since that\u2019s the bulk of their sales anyway.

I know tractors will still need diesel as will any other large operation that uses super heavy equipment. \n\nReckon I\u2019ll have to get a big tank and buy my gasoline from a wholesaler in the future.

        "created_utc": 1728127945.0,
        "selftext": "Could AI really let us communicate with loved ones after death, or is this a dangerous idea?\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about the idea of creating an AI representation of yourself for your family to communicate with after you\u2019re gone. We already have the tech to analyze someone\u2019s personality, habits, and conversations over time, so it\u2019s not hard to imagine future AI capable of simulating how you\u2019d respond.\n\nOn one hand, it\u2019s easy to see how this could be comforting. Imagine your kids asking an AI version of you for advice\u2014whether it\u2019s something practical like unclogging a drain, or more complex, like dealing with life\u2019s ups and downs. It feels like a way to stay connected, right?\n\nBut then\u2026what are the risks? Could this mess with the grieving process? And could the AI actually end up giving advice that\u2019s out of step with who you really were? Worse, if it\u2019s allowed to evolve, it could become a version of you that\u2019s so different, it\u2019s unrecognizable.\n\nAnd another thought\u2014what if someone could piece together enough data on you and create an AI version of you without your consent? A DIY digital version of you that might be out there, interacting with people in ways you\u2019d never approve of.\n\nSo, I\u2019m curious\u2014how would you feel about this kind of tech?\n\n\t\u2022\tDoes it have real potential for good, or is this opening a door we can\u2019t close?\n\n\t\u2022\tIf you had the chance, would you want to leave something like this behind for your family?\n\n\t\u2022\tWhere does this blur the line between memory and reality?",

        "selftext": "I was just thinking, if continuation-of-consciousness mind uploading becomes a reality, so that our bodies become easily replaceable shells, and we exist primarily as digital immortals, then is there any point in traditional human space flight with bodies carried on ships, other than as like the title suggests a type of recreational activity like how people sail around the world for fun/as a challenge of artificial hardship, even though planes exist? \n\nIf mind uploading is possible, then you could send human consciousness to other planets using free-space optical satellite networks, like a future, more robust version of NASA's Deep Space Network, at the speed of light, so you could be beamed to Mars in a few minutes. Your digital file would contain \"printing instructions\" to customize a waiting generic humanoid shell to customize based on your aesthetic profile/preferences. Same thing for travel around the Earth, which without any sort of light speed delay would be essentially near instantaneous teleportation. \n\nFor deep space exploration/colonization, the process would be essentially automated, thousands/millions of ships for redundancy, sent out to all interesting planets/star systems, loaded with digital consciousness packed \"hard drives\" and drones to not just create the waiting colony on the surface but to mine space based resources along the way and build/string along additional waypoints for the deep space network, so eventually once everything is good to go humans waiting on earth can just beam themselves out digitally along the network at light speed, with a customizable humanoid shell waiting for them once their mind file arrives. \n\nIt removes a lot of what makes space travel emotionally resonate with a lot of people, the risk, the danger, the challenges of survival like Mark Whatney growing potatoes on Mars, it becomes kind of boring, just another automated process, albeit on a grand scale. Although I guess it was never really about humans enjoying an adventure or the glory of exploration, it's principally about the propagation of the species in the most efficient way possible. ",

        "selftext": "Remember Sora? Well, Meta apparently developed something like that, but better:\n\nhttps://ai.meta.com/research/movie-gen/\n\nThese are comments related to Sora, but I felt like they still ring true since Movie Gen is apparently better than that:\n\n> In 5-10 years we\u2019ll be talking about capabilities not even being envisioned now, so most of the answers to this question are off the mark. Today\u2019s tech will have a marginal disruption, but 10-15 product evolutions of AI will be completely different.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/kri6wq9/\n\n> it's not going to be long before AI can turn a script into a movie. Not just animated. It will be able to make it look live action. I don't know that going straight to image generation is necessarily the best approach. It will be more limited in what you can create and less editable, you have to take what you can get. It's already hard for image generators to be consistent. Having to create a whole movie there will be so many opportunities for mistakes that it will be hard to ever create an AI that can produce quality results.\n> \n> There will be more than one approach. AI using a computer generating program that is already used, might prove a better approach. Modern approaches to animating have character models and assets that animators then manipulate, give animation to, whatever those digital objects are supposed to do. Animation is different from visual style, animation is if someone looks fluid, if it does what it's supposed to do and it seems natural, some animation styles don't necessarily aim to make the movement look realistic, but that's the intention.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/kribfuj/\n\n> The inevitable result is prompting an AI to generate a custom movie or tv episode on demand. That\u2019s months away.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krin9w3/\n\n> Sora is as low quality as AI generated videos will ever be in future. It I\u2019ll get better and better wih more options and ease of use,. AI will certainly dominate in 15 years. The amount\n> \n> Creativity will mushroom. We\u2019ve seen this in ditital photography. Friends of mine now have photos of birds, insects, our hiking trips, etc that rival anything from the top quality magazines of 20 years ago.\n> \n> In addition are resources. Thr investment in AI dwarfs that of Hollywood multiple times over. And, it\u2019s also dwarfs thr American entertainment industry outside of thr USA in China, Japan, etc.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krh5zd8/\n\n> > Doesn't matter if anyone can \"produce\" a \"Hollywood tier\" movie, because 90% won't be as good as dedicated movies, it'll be a flood of trash, which users won't try to sift through hoping for a good one. Also what value does a AI generated movie give when none will see it because Marvel or Disney's name isn't attached to it? There's a reason why 99.9% of YouTuber or shows or movies essentially don't exist, it's because they're not a brand. You could generate 1000's of hours of content, but they won't ever be seen by others.\n> \n> I think you're looking at it wrong. It's not that people can make AI movies and then share with others - it's more that people will be able to create their OWN movies, on demand, - they don't need to wait for a studio to create the content they want - they simply ask AI to create a movie in a specific genre and with specific requests. I'm seeing this being a reality within 10 years. I think you're putting too much value in \"the brand\".\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krhaeoo/\n\n> In 5 years time it will be something like: -Computer I want to see Predator vs Rambo /Generating script /Generating scenes /Rendering, movie will start playing in 60 minutes\n> \n> In 10 years it starts playing immediately and you'll be able to play in it too with VR set (or direct to brain) and adapt in real time.

Maybe not. But the public? That's another story.\n> \n> A great burger can be amazing, but people still gobble down McDonald's happily. If they can create their own \"good enough\" entertainment from their own prompts, it could seriously impact viewing habits. Naturally, there will always be those who prefer quality, but there are a hell of a lot of McD's lovers out there.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/krjjdem/\n\n> Good point actually.

OpenAI claim that a surprisingly good level of consistency can be achieved just by scaling up the compute. Now combine that with other algorithmic improvements and imagine where we are in another year. Consider also that OpenAI think this might be a way to achieve AGI as well. SORA certainly will not be able to replace movies, but the model that comes after might be able to, and either way, it'll probably be sooner than we think.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1awfp7w/how_much_of_an_impact_will_sora_and_other/kripwi7/\n\n> Within the right framework, i.e. an interface that allows saving certain environments / characters and changing specific areas or parameters based on text AND image input: The way movies are made is most definitely going to be affected by this tech.

The sizes of the short form and long form video industries are on a trajectory to intersect at some point. It does not strike me as certain that a show or film is, in the long term, the content form our minds can be most made to seek out by industry.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1aws29z/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krjsorg/\n\n> I agree regards technologies that do not create their own positive feedback loops. I disagree that all technology falls into this category.\n> \n> The moment an AI can build the next best AI faster than a human, all bets are off. I am not making any claims about how close to that moment we are, but I find the claim that it is certainly more than 25 years in the future hard to defend.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1aws29z/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krjxz6t/\n\n> There is some truth to this, but nobody really knows where we are on the sigmoid of progress on gen AI.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1aws29z/will_hollywood_completely_cease_to_exist_very/krjxwn2/\n\nGiven these, do you expect Hollywood to completely cease to exist immediately once Sora and/or Meta Movie Gen is/are released this or next year? Why or why not?\n\nP.S. I advise you all to read everything carefully before posting any comments.",

You could even say, \"upgrade this shader to 2020s GLSL standards with nice metal reflections,\" and AI could provide modern, optimized shader options.\n\nTexture upgrades could be handled by image generation models, creating high-resolution assets from old BMPs. \ud83c\udfa8It seems possible we\u2019ll soon see AI-driven tools that automatically upgrade entire asset libraries.\n\nI'd love to get an open-source version of Mario Kart and Quake 3 Arena and transliterate them to the latest Unity3d/Unreal engines, and then batch process all the textures and shaders to be super HiFi.\n\nWhen will AI port entire game engines across platforms? So far, that seems beyond reach. It can handle shaders and code refactoring, but the engine mechanics are complex.\n\nWhat do you think: are there programmatic processes in development that could fully automate the upgrade of older games to modern engines and standards?

        "selftext": "Ever since I've read about solein I've had this picture in my head of people growing it at home rather than it being grown large scale in labs. Solein is a fermentation process where electricity is used to feed microbial cells which then grows into a protein powder. According to the company it's called cellular agriculture (rather than precision fermentation which uses designed cells). I keep imagining this kitchen appliance where you press a button and out comes protein sludge which you then cook with: in pancake batter or bread or oatmeal etc. When the container is close to empty you turn the electricity on to replenish the microbes. But I don't know anything about the logistics of the fermentation process. Maybe someone else who's more well read in it can tell me if it's theoretically possible. ",

I wonder if any companies are already working on this? I\u2019d love to contribute in some way, even though I\u2019m not a developer. I have a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics (from a top 100 school) and am thinking about learning more about UX design.\n\n\n\nIf no one is working on this yet, how could someone like me get involved?

To what extent will it be possible to restore the former fitness and appearance of a person who is, for example, 70 years old? Assuming that such anti-aging therapies appear today, do you think it would be possible to restore people to their former fitness and appearance after years of accumulated aging processes? If so, what would that look like?\n\nWhat is concerning is the fact that if reversing the aging of the body is not possible, many of today\u2019s people, even if they live to see such therapies, would still be biologically stuck at a fairly advanced age.\n\nWhat do you think, what are the prospects in this regard?",

Such features could dramatically improve productivity and enhance user experience when interacting with AI systems.\n\nLooking forward:\n\n* **What challenges do you foresee with the increasing volume of AI-based conversations?**\n* **What kinds of tools or features will be necessary to manage these interactions effectively?**\n* **Do you think AI interaction management will eventually become as important as managing email or other forms of communication?**",

By the same token, if someone has a world-changing idea and they don't share it and it isn't heard by anyone in a position to *do anything* with it, does it make an impact?  After thinking for a long time about why it is that most ideas are not shared and, in fact, go to waste, upon reflection, I decided that many of these ideas are not shared for fear that someone else might usurp an idea.\n\nPatents are onerously expensive in most countries, average $10,000 in cost in the United States.  Without a patent, there is no possibility of receiving credit for an idea or of being able to commodify it.  Patents were not always so expensive to obtain, but changes in regulations over the past 30 or so years have brought about this state of affairs.\n\nAfter exploring the possibility of obtaining a patent, I decided that this was not a practical pursuit.  What I found that I was empowered to do was to simply use the Internet for its originally intended purpose and to share my ideas that they might make a difference without regard to personal gain.\n\nI shared my first invention online in 2008 and learned a few years later that it had become integral to a pair of missile defense systems.  Since then, I have expanded my body of work to 394 publications concerning physics, technology and medicine.  Important problems have been solved including that of how to produce sustained fusion reactions, how to extract energy from such reactions, how to overcome stealth technology, how to improve photovoltaic processes, how to greatly enhance computers through the use of miniaturized atomic clocks and literally hundreds of others.  I have explained my ideas in the simplest possible terms using a series of two-page abstracts, all of which are free to use and share in the public domain.\n\nAnyone with any technical or personal questions should send a PM.\n\n[https://archive.org/details/Collection\\_of\\_Ideas\\_DARPA\\_Didnt\\_Want](https://archive.org/details/Collection_of_Ideas_DARPA_Didnt_Want)",

This is important because during my undergraduate years, I would prefer to focus on the most promising approach. \n\nJust an idea- it may be impractical or infeasible, but I'd like to know what you think- If we could grow a fully functioning neocortex in lab, derived from stem cells of a profoundly gifted individual, or from embryos selected for the trait, and implant it into another human, would it affect their cognitive abilities? Is it possible for their sense of continuity to be maintained so their conscious self is preserved, while enhancing other abilities? \n\nDo you believe it would possible to biologically enhance the intelligence or g-factor of any human up to the historically maximum possible recorded levels, say John von Neumann, within this century? Or even domain-specific abilities, such mathematical ability, pattern recognition, spatial or verbal ability? Why or why not? \n\nAnyone else working on cognitive enhancement as a primary goal, or aware of researchers or labs working on projects revolving around related themes? I've been collecting resources, links, articles and stuff related to neural engineering and cognitive enhancement for a quite while now, and find neuroscience itself fascinating, though I still frequently doubt if I have the aptitude to be a researcher and make any significant contribution, and then remember that it's still my brain that's the cause of my perceived lack of ability and underconfidence!

        "title": "How will the US federal debt get resolved and how can we prepare for it?",
        "created_utc": 1727460318.0,
        "selftext": "As many of you know, the current US federal debt is just north of $35,409,072,000,000 (35t) and growing by about $2 trillion (2t) a year. We pay about $890 billion/yr to service that debt, and it is one of the top five expenses of the US government. An analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget center estimates that this will be unsustainable in about 20 years (https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2023/10/6/when-does-federal-debt-reach-unsustainable-levels). However, prior to that happening, there are likely several stages we will go through, and I\u2019m curious whether you agree with my prognostications:\n\n1. Fiscal responsibility: That ended with the Clinton administration, which was the last one to actually balance the budget. We then made some effort to discuss the debt and both Democrats and Republicans, such as Romney, spoke about the urgency of reducing the debt, at least during the debates.\n2. Grabbing stage: Currently, both parties are not discussing the debt much. That\u2019s because they are actively engaged in trying to secure the strongest negotiating position by grabbing as many benefits as they can for their constituents. Specifically, Republicans want tax cuts for the wealthy and Democrats want to increase spending for social services. Both know that when they finally have to negotiate, they will likely do a 1:1 swap. So if the Republicans can grab $2 trillion in tax cuts now, and have to give up half of that in order to get Democrats to agree to spending cuts, the Republicans are still ahead by $1 trillion in tax cuts for their wealthy donors. If the Republicans can grab $3 trillion in tax cuts, and have to give up half, they will instead be ahead by $1.5 trillion. This will likely go on for another 5-10 years until 2035. So, it remains in the interest of both parties to \u201cignore\u201d the debt as they try to grab benefits now.\n3. Erosion stage: As the debt increases and interest payments consume even more of the federal budget, the US government will have to start cutting back on highway spending, defense and eventually social security/medicare and divert the money to pay the yearly federal interest to avoid defaulting. Education (school, universities), environmental safety, highways, airports, etc. will start to wither. Our infrastructure and investment in R&D will erode and our military will be cut back so that we can no longer enforce US power and favorable trade agreements around the world. Services for the elderly will be the last to be gutted since the elderly vote. US economic growth will decrease and we will spend more time in recessions or have negative economic growth; the stock markets will decline.\n4. Crisis stage: Likely around 2040-2045, some type of crisis will occur. Another pandemic, or perhaps a group of countries refuses to keep buying US treasuries (perhaps the BRIC countries, in order to coerce US foreign policy concessions). The federal government will literally have only a few weeks/months to find a way to pay tens of trillions of dollars immediately to avoid a default. There is only one answer: print money. The US treasury can do this quickly once authorized by Congress and the Federal Reserve, which is inevitable. This will result in significant inflation. Currently, US dollars account for about $150 trillion of the $400 trillion world economy. So adding $32 trillion of new currency would devalue the $150 trillion by about 20%, so we would likely see about 20-40% inflation that year. The main hedge against inflation is commodities (wheat, gold, real estate, etc.). For regular folks like us, only real estate is viable. At the least, you can grow some crops in your yard (when tomatoes cost $50 each at the grocery store). Gold is a possibility, but you can\u2019t eat gold. However, buying real estate is a little tricky due to climate change. The coasts are typical real-estate hotbeds, but will flood, and other options, like Arizona/Texas will be uninhabitable due to drought/fires/heat. In the US, the only options are the far Northwest, Midwestern states around the Great Lakes, which have plenty of access to water, and far Northeast (NY/Vermont/Maine). Commercial real estate, like REITs, are a bad idea because the economy will be tanking.\n\nFrom a personal finance planning stage, it seems like the best options are the standard mantra of a diversified portfolio, expecting some money from Social Security (which will likely keep paying, but perhaps at only 30-50% of current rates; if you have a pension, you'll likely also only get 30-50% of what you expected), IRAs, and primarily investing in real estate (specifically, make sure to pay off your house mortgage and try to live in the northern part of the US). We should have the bulk of our investments in residential real estate. Another option would be to get dual Canadian citizenship, perhaps no later than 2030, since Canada is expected to benefit from climate change considerably, and buy some land there.\n\nWhat do you think? I\u2019m happy to update this post based on your comments. \u00a0",

        "created_utc": 1727257116.0,
        "selftext": "Let\u2019s imagine a future where\u00a0mind uploading\u00a0is possible. How would we create a simulated environment for a mind that has been transferred into a digital space? Two speculative approaches come to mind:\n\n1. Upload the mind and simulate an external environment: In this scenario, the uploaded mind exists in a fully simulated world, similar to a virtual reality. This external environment would be built and controlled by external systems, with detailed rules of physics, sensory inputs, and even interactions with other minds. It could be highly realistic and shared among multiple uploaded minds, allowing for social interactions and a structured \u201cworld.\u201d The drawback? This would require vast computing resources to simulate every detail in real time, making it an extremely complex and resource-heavy process.\n2. Upload the mind and let it generate its own environment: In this alternative, the environment isn\u2019t simulated externally but instead generated by the mind itself, somewhat like how dreams work. The uploaded mind would create its own experience, crafting its surroundings based on internal processes, memories, and desires. This approach is lighter on computational resources, as it relies on the mind\u2019s own capacity to build its environment. However, the experience might be more subjective, fluid, and prone to instability\u2014similar to a dream state. Also, each mind could be isolated in its own self-generated world, with limited or no shared experiences with others.\n\nBoth approaches offer different possibilities: one focusing on shared, externally controlled worlds at high computational cost, and the other relying on the mind\u2019s internal mechanisms to generate a unique, personal environment.\n\nWhich do you think would be more compelling for an uploaded mind? Would you prefer a detailed external simulation or a self-generated, dream-like world?",

        "title": "Speculative Concept: What do you think about Cyclical Universes and Matter Rearrangement?",
        "created_utc": 1727198389.0,
        "selftext": "The speculative theory suggests that the universe may go through an infinite cycle of Big Bangs and Big Crunches, with no beginning or end. Matter is thought to constantly rearrange itself, and after an infinite number of cycles, it could potentially result in a configuration similar to the current one. Individual identity is discussed in terms of the continuity of matter, without any conscious connection to previous experiences, raising philosophical questions about morality and responsibility.\n\nThis version highlights that the idea is speculative and not established scientific fact.\n\n  \n**Cyclical Universes**  \nThe theory of cyclical universes suggests that the universe does not have a defined beginning or end but continuously expands and contracts, going through a series of Big Bangs and Big Crunches. This implies an infinite cycle of creation and destruction.\n\n**Rearrangement of Matter**  \nAfter each Big Bang, the matter in the universe is distributed and rearranged. Since matter is neither created nor destroyed (according to the law of conservation of matter), the existing atoms and molecules will be used in the formation of the new universe.\n\n  \n**Infinite Configurations**  \nIn a cyclical universe, it is theoretically possible that, after an infinite number of Big Bangs, we may arrive at a configuration similar to the current one. Considering that there are an infinite number of possible combinations of arrangements of fundamental elements (such as protons, neutrons, and electrons) that make up matter, then from the perspective of probability theory, it is possible for these configurations to repeat. This idea is similar to the principle that, by repeating an event an infinite number of times, it becomes inevitable that certain outcomes will occur again.\n\n**Instantaneity and the Perception of Time**  \nAfter a cycle of Big Bang and collapse, there may be no subjective experience of time between \"death\" and \"birth.\" Thus, the individual may not perceive time as linear or sequential but would experience an instantaneous return to a new life, without conscious connection to the previous existence. This would make the return to a similar configuration appear instantaneous, as there would be no continuity of consciousness between cycles.\n\n**The Philosophy of Identity**\n\n1. **The Concept of the \"Self\"**: Philosophically, personal identity is often linked to the memories and experiences accumulated throughout life. In the case of returning to a similar configuration, this \"new self\" would be composed of the same matter and energy, but without the connection to prior experiences.\n2. **Identity and Memory**: Without memories, this \"new self\" would essentially be a different individual, even though constructed from the same fundamental elements. This raises questions about what it means to be \"you.\" Identity is not defined solely by material components but also by the continuity of consciousness and personal experiences.\n3. **The Phenomenon of Awakening**: From the perspective of an instantaneous return, the individual would experience a \"birth\" in which all previous aspects of identity have vanished. This suggests a fundamental separation between material identity and experiential identity. Philosophically, we may ask: if I were returned to the same material configuration, who am I? Am I the same individual, or a completely new \"self\"?\n4. **Ethical and Moral Consequences**: If we were to accept that these returns occur, we might reconsider concepts of responsibility, morality, and the value of life. Subjective identity becomes problematic, given that each \"new self\" would begin without the baggage of prior experiences.\n\nWhat is your perspective on this theory? Do you find it feasible that, after an infinite number of Big Bangs, the universe could reach a configuration similar to the current one? I have gathered several theories and universal laws supporting this conclusion, which are only relevant in the context of the cyclical universe theory. Have you encountered any relevant theories or research in this field? I am eager to hear your thoughts and suggestions!",

        "selftext": "Hello All.  I\u2019ve been pondering a question\nI\u2019ve had for some time, but can\u2019t find a specific answer online.  An AI system like Open AI\u2019s latest GPT, once trained, may have trillions of parameters and, indeed, that number will grow with new releases.  I don\u2019t really understand how, or if, a parameter is stored, which is the foundation of my confusion.  Can an AI system be turned off and restarted without losing its connections?  Does it have to stay powered up forever once trained?\n\nIt seems any new AI needs to be trained at great cost.  That suggests that you can\u2019t just feed an AI a file of parameters from a prior trained AI, then layer on some additional training.  Can parameters not be stored in a file because the (neurons) in one system are different from another?  Can one AI train another by using its own parameters, allowing the other system to make its own connections?\n\n Any clear thoughts on the matter to help me understand will greatly appreciated.  Thank you!",

If that\u2019s the case, and that actually works, couldn\u2019t the same process work on earth? Would just have to be a larger scale. And secondly, couldn\u2019t we also pair that with large scale air purification systems in the larger cities to assist with pollution???

        "selftext": "We will need lots of rules and regulations in place, traffic rules for the sky.  One simple rule to consider: minimum and maximum altitude.  \n\nI would think a minimum altitude (apart from takeoff/landing obviously) should give the pilot/driver/AI flying the car enough time to correct for mistakes, to avoid a crash.  So, maybe 500ft?  Is this the only factor when setting a minimum altitude?\n\nA sensible maximum altitude might be IDK 1,000ft?  You don't want to be anywhere near the cruising altitude of passenger jets but I don't think flying cars will ever be designed to fly that high.  You wouldn't want to be so high that lower air pressure + temperature becomes a problem.  What other factors should we consider?\n\nWhat other traffic rules will we need?  Takeoff and Landing should be vertical or nearly vertical, a sensible top speed which increases with altitude?",

It's called *Extreme Experiments & Unhinged Hypotheses*\u2014a lightning round of 5-minute talks where imagination reigns supreme. \n\nThe conference is appropriately named the Zombie Apocalypse Medicine Meeting (ZAMM), and looks to share complex topics about the future of humanity...but through the lens of the zombie apocalypse, as the name suggests. It's imaginative and radically interdisciplinary bridging science and the arts to grapple with the most pressing challenges of the present and the future. This year's meeting focuses on the ways humans manage apocalyptic risks, especially through cooperation, storytelling, entertainment and play, and I can't help but imagine incorporating these ideas into our theories about the future. The goal of ZAMM, as stated on the website, is to reduce the global burden of zombification and contribute to apocalypse prevention and preparedness through interdisciplinary engagement.  \n  \nWhile we might not all show up at this conference (though it would fascinating if we had a reddit takeover at this event, with wild theories flying around) I'm curious-- If you had a chance to present radical, out-of-the-box research designs, speculative theories, or experimental frameworks that defy constraints, what would you be interested in talk about? It could be a study too ambitious to fund, a concept so daring it might just work, a theory on the cutting edge of science fiction...what would you talk about?\n\n\\*\\*Not sure if I'm allowed to post links to more info on this conference, but I added the link to their main website.

        "selftext": "In a recent Space Cafe Podcast episode, Dr. Pascal Lee from SETI and NASA Ames shared some intriguing predictions about the search for extraterrestrial life:\n\n1. We will likely find the first example of alien life this century.\n2. Mars is a prime candidate for this discovery.\n3. However, detecting signals from alien civilizations is unlikely in the near future.\n4. We might be alone in our galaxy.\n5. Even if alien civilizations exist and can communicate, they might choose not to.\n\nDr. Lee's view on intelligent alien life is notably less optimistic than many of his SETI colleagues. He emphasizes that the ability to communicate doesn't guarantee the desire or choice to do so.\n\nThis perspective raises interesting questions about the nature of intelligent life and civilizations:\n\n* What factors might lead a civilization to remain silent?\n* How might this affect our own approach to space exploration and potential contact?\n* What implications does this have for the Fermi Paradox?\n\nAs we continue to explore our solar system and beyond, how do you think these predictions will shape our search for extraterrestrial life? And what might be the implications for humanity's future if we truly are alone in our galaxy?",

        "created_utc": 1726293916.0,
        "selftext": "Hey Reddit,  \nI\u2019ve been thinking about where society might be headed, especially with the rapid rise of AI and automation. While the actual ways AI is going to change things can't be entirely predicted, we need to continue thinking about where it might take us. So, I'd like to present one idea I often consider.  \n  \nWhat if, in the not-so-distant future, we could move beyond traditional jobs and money? I\u2019m talking about a lifestyle where instead of working to survive or chasing wealth, we live for three things: **Pleasure**, **Passion**, and **Prestige**. I call it the *3P Lifestyle*.\n\n# So, What\u2019s the Idea?\n\nAI and automation are changing the game. Soon, machines could take over pretty much every task we now think of as a \u201cjob.\u201d Combine that with tech like 3D printing, and we\u2019re looking at a future where producing goods is quick, easy, and efficient. With AI solving resource scarcity, the need for economic competition and wealth fades away. Why bother hoarding money or resources when AI can distribute what\u2019s needed?\n\nBut this isn't happening overnight. It's a **long-term shift**, where we\u2019ll gradually move away from labor-based economies. Eventually, we could reach a point where instead of being stuck in the grind, we live for things that make life fulfilling.\n\n# The 3Ps: What Do They Mean?\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m envisioning:\n\n* **Pleasure**: With the basic necessities handled, people would focus on what makes them happy. Leisure, relationships, personal well-being\u2014all the stuff that we often don\u2019t have time for now.\n* **Passion**: Imagine being able to chase your true interests without worrying about paying bills. You could dedicate your time to whatever you love\u2014whether that\u2019s creating art, solving scientific problems, or starting projects for the community.\n* **Prestige**: Instead of wealth, people would be recognized for their contributions to society. Whether you\u2019re a genius inventor, a brilliant artist, or someone who\u2019s improving life for others, prestige comes from what you give back.\n\n# How Would It Actually Work?\n\nIn this future, **resources are the new currency**\u2014but not in the traditional sense. AI manages resource allocation, ensuring that everyone gets what they need. Here\u2019s how I see it:\n\n* **Basic Needs Covered**: AI would figure out what individuals and families need to live comfortably and make sure those essentials are provided. That means things like food, healthcare, energy, and education are handled.\n* **Extra Resources for Contribution**: Want more than the basics? Contribute to society in meaningful ways. People who do important work\u2014like creating new tech, art, or social programs\u2014would earn more resources. It\u2019s a way to reward innovation and effort, without tying it to money.\n* **Project-Based Resource Allocation**: Big projects, like developing new technologies or saving the environment, could get extra resources. AI would help figure out which projects are worth backing and allocate resources accordingly.\n\n# The Problem of Greed\n\nBut let\u2019s be real\u2014**human greed** is still a huge risk. Even in a system where AI handles resources, if humans are in charge of making final decisions, there\u2019s always the chance that some might hoard or abuse the system. So how do we stop that?\n\n* **AI Audits for Transparency**: One idea is that while humans have authority, AI could run regular **audits** on those decisions. AI can\u2019t intervene in government or directly control resources, but it would make the audits public. That way, everyone can see how decisions are being made and if people in power are being fair.\n* **Accountability through Transparency**: If the public has access to this info, it becomes a way to keep power in check. People would know if resources are being mismanaged or if someone\u2019s taking more than they should. And since everything\u2019s out in the open, society as a whole can decide if the system is working.\n\n# It\u2019s a Long-Term Shift\n\nThis kind of change isn\u2019t happening tomorrow. It\u2019s a gradual process, but one that could unfold as AI becomes more capable. Here\u2019s how I imagine the transition:\n\n1. **More Automation**: AI is already replacing some jobs, and this will keep growing. As more sectors become automated, we\u2019ll start shifting away from traditional labor systems.\n2. **Changing Values**: As people rely less on work for survival, we\u2019ll need a cultural shift. Success won\u2019t be about money anymore; it\u2019ll be about creativity, contribution, and well-being.\n3. **AI and Resource Management**: Over time, AI will take on more responsibility for managing resources. That will free people from needing to \u201cearn\u201d in the traditional sense and let them focus on what really matters.\n\n# Living for the 3Ps\n\nIn the end, the 3P lifestyle is all about shifting our focus from survival to fulfillment:\n\n* **Pleasure**: When you\u2019re not tied down by work, you can focus on the things that make life worth living.\n* **Passion**: Freed from the need to make money, you can chase your true interests and do work that excites and fulfills you.\n* **Prestige**: Instead of valuing wealth, society will reward those who contribute in meaningful ways, creating a new kind of recognition based on impact, not income.\n\n# Thoughts? Could AI-driven transparency and auditing help keep greed in check? How do you feel about living in a world focused on Pleasure, Passion, and Prestige instead of money?\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*Disclaimer\\*\\*\\*  \nThough it goes without saying these days, AI was used to write portions of and structure this article.

        "created_utc": 1726296552.0,
        "selftext": "\nHave you ever thought about what school would be like if there were no teachers? David Game College in London is testing this idea with the UK's first AI-driven classroom, where 20 students learn without traditional human instructors. Instead, they engage with advanced AI platforms and VR headsets\u2014pretty wild, right? For around \u00a327,000 a year, students get personalized learning experiences tailored to their needs.\n\nThe AI adapts lessons based on students' progress, giving immediate feedback and support. But it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are concerns about students relying on AI too much and missing out on essential human interactions. To address this, learning coaches will still be around to assist and monitor student well-being.\n\nAs someone who grew up with the classic teacher-student dynamic, I can\u2019t help but wonder how this will impact the development of social and emotional skills. What do you think? Is this the future of education, or are we losing something important by removing human teachers? Share your thoughts or experiences with technology in education!

Could this be a case of science fiction turning into reality in the coming decades?\n\nRecent discoveries, including the detection of water molecules in its sunlit regions, have sparked interest in Clavius as a potential site for lunar habitation. With its vast, relatively flat floor and intriguing geological features, Clavius could serve as an ideal location for future lunar bases, enabling scientists to explore the Moon further and study its mysteries.\n\nI recently hosted an episode of the Space Cafe Podcast where I sat down with Pascal Lee (SETI, NASA AMES and Mars Institute) , who touched upon this fascinating idea.

        "selftext": "Quantum computing has been a hot topic for years, but lately, we've seen some pretty incredible developments. Companies like IBM, Google, and startups like IonQ are pushing the boundaries with more stable qubits and better error correction techniques. Google\u2019s recent claim of quantum supremacy and IBM\u2019s 1000+ qubit chip are setting the stage for a new digital revolution.\n\nI\u2019m curious: How close do you all think we are to real-world applications of quantum computing? Will we start seeing breakthroughs in areas like drug discovery, clean energy, or materials science soon? Or are we still decades away from practical, widespread use?\n\nWhat do you think will be the first *massive* impact of quantum computing on our society?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and predictions!",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI\u2019m excited to share an idea I\u2019ve been developing for an Open Source Electric Utility Vehicle designed to meet L7e homologation standards. The goal is to create a practical, functional, and robust vehicle that prioritizes utility over aesthetics\u2014think of it as a car where every part serves a purpose, from reinforced bumpers to secure, functional doors.\n\nKey Features:\n\n    \u2022Electric Powertrain: Fully electric, designed for efficiency and ease of maintenance.\n    \u2022L7e Homologation: We are focusing on the European L7e classification, which includes:\n    \u2022L7e-CU (Cargo Utility): This baseline model is designed as a cargo vehicle capable of carrying up to 3 Euro pallets, ideal for urban deliveries and light industrial use.\n    \u2022L7e-CP (Passenger Vehicle): Future plans include adapting the design to create a passenger version for urban commuting, with seats for multiple passengers.\n    \u2022Component Integration: The vehicle will be built by integrating existing, off-the-shelf components such as aluminum profiles, ready-made suspension systems, steering assemblies, and in-wheel motors to streamline the build process and keep costs down.\n    \u2022Control Systems: The vehicle\u2019s control systems will be based on popular platforms like Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Arduino, and other microcontrollers to ensure accessibility for a wide range of users.\n    \u2022Custom Design Elements: While the project focuses on integration, we will also be designing the vehicle body and creating adapters to connect all components seamlessly.\n    \u2022Documentation and Backend Support: Comprehensive documentation, including CAD files, software repositories, and support channels, will ensure that anyone can build, modify, or improve the vehicle.\n\nWhy Open Source?\n\nThe open-source nature of this project is intended to foster innovation and collaboration within the community. By sharing designs and ideas freely, we hope to inspire sustainable transportation solutions that are accessible to everyone. We believe this collaborative approach can drive new advancements in utility vehicle design, particularly in the electric vehicle space.\n\nWe\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this concept! What features would you find most useful in an electric utility vehicle, and what challenges do you think we should consider?\n\nThanks for reading, and looking forward to your feedback!",

It turns out that this is bad news not only for humanity but also for the planet, because more humans means more available resources and less destructive impact on nature.\n\n> Global population growth peaked in the late 1960s, when the average woman had 4.5 children, and it has been declining ever since. In country after country, we have seen fertility rates take a nosedive after the death rate did the same thing.\n\n> according to a 2020 study in *The Lancet*, we will never reach even 10 billion, and the global population will start shrinking as early as the 2060s\n\n> the more people there are, the more solutions to problems will be found. Many predictions of population doom never materialised because they started from the misguided assumption that the impact of the average individual on the planet (in terms of food, resource use, pollution, and so on) has remained constant throughout history.\n\n> none of this progress happens of its own accord. We need massive investments in fundamental scientific research, and collaborations between academia and industry, to bring all these technologies to maturity. We need a society that believes in technological progress to improve the lot of humanity (and, eventually, of other animals). And here comes the crux: none of that is likely to happen in societies with dwindling and aging populations.\n\nLots of food for thought in that article!",

I think it would be cool to see a breakdown of different technologies that are being worked on to see what problems have already been solved and what still needs to be solved for the tech to become a reality. \n\nDoes something like this exist? The only website about the future I know of is future timeline but as far as I know they don't break down things down so we can see exactly how far along we are in developing certain technology. ",

Last year, we installed about 460 GW globally. Solar PV is not just a partial substitute for oil, it\u2019s a cheaper and better energy source in every way that matters.\n\n> Corollary: Our techno-capital machine is a thermodynamic mechanism that systematically hunts for and then maximally exploits the cheapest energy it can find. When it unlocks cheaper energy, first coal, then oil, then gas, and now solar, it drives up the rate of economic growth, due to an expanded spread between energy cost and application value.\n\n> In other words, we\u2019re now about a decade into a three decade process (the ~sixth industrial revolution) where the entire world economy and its industrial stack is eagerly switching to solar PV as its preferred source of cheap energy, creating enormous value.\n\n> the companies and industries that underlie our entire way of life are on a fast track to disruption from below, providing the first opportunity in a century, and probably the last opportunity ever, to rewrite the rule book and ownership structure of the world of atoms.\n\n> More or less extreme changes to [various energy intensive industries] are indicated by the emergence of extremely cheap solar power. These changes present infinite possibilities for disruption of the large, risk averse, growth averse incumbents. The incipient emergence of solar cheaper than fossil fuels is probably the last opportunity to reshuffle the deck in terms of ownership of these various means of production, and represents a unified, industry wide investment thesis with unlimited capacity for outsize returns in response to technical innovation.",

This concept suggests that, instead of relying solely on physical technologies, we might harness our mental and spiritual capabilities to bridge the gap between dimensions.\n\nSeveral futuristic theories and speculative technologies align with this idea. For instance, advances in neurotechnology and brain-computer interfaces might enhance our ability to explore consciousness in new ways. If consciousness can be mapped or modulated, we could theoretically develop methods to connect with dimensions beyond our own. This would be a radical shift from our current scientific paradigm but aligns with the vision of future cognitive and technological advancements.\n\nMoreover, the growing interest in consciousness studies and psychedelic research points towards a future where expanded states of awareness might be more accessible and scientifically understood. As we push the boundaries of our understanding, the idea of connecting with interdimensional NHI through advanced consciousness techniques might become a part of mainstream scientific inquiry.\n\nIn addition, various philosophical and esoteric traditions, such as those in Advaita Vedanta and shamanism, suggest that all existence is interconnected through a unified consciousness. These ancient insights could inform future technologies and methods for exploring consciousness, potentially leading us to new ways of interacting with interdimensional entities.\n\nIn summary, as we advance technologically and expand our understanding of consciousness, the idea of connecting with interdimensional NHI through pure awareness becomes a fascinating possibility. Exploring this intersection between consciousness and future technologies might open up new frontiers in our quest to understand and interact with the broader universe.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this concept? Could future advancements in consciousness and technology make this idea a reality?\n\nLooking forward to your insights!",

        "created_utc": 1725484520.0,
        "selftext": "  \nIn an upcoming interview on the Space Cafe Podcast, planetary scientist Pascal Lee presented a provocative vision for the future of space exploration. As we grapple with the challenges of interstellar travel, Lee suggests that the solution may lie not in advancing rocket technology, but in redefining what we consider \"human.\"\n\n# The Limits of Biological Humans in Space\n\nInterstellar travel poses numerous challenges for biological humans:\n\n1. Extremely long journey times (potentially thousands of years)\n2. Radiation exposure\n3. Psychological stress of prolonged isolation\n4. Limited resources for life support\n5. Aging and generational shifts during travel\n\n# Enter Artificial Humans\n\nLee proposes that as the line between humans and artificial intelligence blurs, we may create a new category of explorers:\n\n* Entities with human-level intelligence and emotional capacity\n* Physically resilient to the harsh conditions of space\n* Potentially immortal or with extremely long lifespans\n* Ability to \"hibernate\" or power down during long journeys\n* No need for traditional life support systems\n\n# Advantages of Artificial Human Explorers\n\n1. **Longevity**: Could survive journeys lasting thousands of years\n2. **Resilience**: Engineered to withstand radiation and other space hazards\n3. **Efficiency**: Lower resource requirements compared to biological humans\n4. **Adaptability**: Could be designed for specific mission parameters\n5. **Representative of Humanity**: Would carry human knowledge, values, and goals\n\n# Ethical and Philosophical Implications\n\nThis concept raises profound questions:\n\n* What defines humanity? Is it our biological form or our consciousness and values?\n* How would we ensure these artificial humans truly represent us?\n* What rights would these entities have?\n* How would this change our approach to space colonization?\n\n# The Path Forward\n\nWhile this technology doesn't exist yet, rapid advancements in AI, robotics, and biotechnology are bringing us closer to this possibility. Lee suggests that this could be the next step in human evolution - a technological leap that allows us to transcend our biological limitations and truly become a spacefaring species.\n\nWhat do you think, Futurology? Is this the key to unlocking the stars, or does it present more challenges than it solves? How might this reshape our understanding of humanity and our place in the cosmos?\n\n",

        "created_utc": 1725476666.0,
        "selftext": "Post:I've been exploring a novel concept in cancer treatment that combines elements of stem cell therapy, cellular reprogramming, and immunotherapy. I wanted to share it here and get feedback from this community.The Concept:Stem Cell Harvesting: Stem cells would be obtained from the patient, either through a blood draw or by harvesting them from bone marrow.Cellular Reprogramming: These stem cells would be reprogrammed using specific genes or proteins to transform them into specialized cancer-killing immune cells. This step goes beyond the typical methods that focus on modifying existing immune cells.Targeted Therapy: The newly reprogrammed immune cells would be infused back into the patient's body, functioning similarly to existing immunotherapies, but with potentially more diverse and targeted immune responses.Potential Benefits:Personalization: Since the cells come from the patient\u2019s own body, this method could lead to highly personalized and potentially more effective cancer treatment.Reduced Side Effects: Utilizing the patient's own stem cells might decrease the risk of adverse reactions compared to some other cancer treatments.Broader Immune Response: The reprogramming process could create a more varied set of immune cells, potentially enhancing the body's ability to fight cancer.Why I'm Sharing This:While elements of this concept exist in isolation, combining them in this way could represent a new frontier in cancer treatment. However, I'm curious to hear from experts and enthusiasts:Is this concept technically feasible with current or near-future technology?What challenges would need to be addressed to make this a reality?How could this approach be further developed or tested?I\u2019m really excited to hear your thoughts and start a discussion around this idea.

        "selftext": "I figured it would be a fun little discussion to see what most of us are hoping we'll live to see in terms of technology and medicine in the future. Especially as we'll each likely have slightly different answers.\n\nI'll go first, as ever since I turned 34 two months ago, I've thought an awful lot about it. I'm hoping I'll end up seeing the cures for many forms of cancers, but in particular lung and ovarian cancer, as both have claimed the lives of most of my family members. I'd also like to see teeth and hair regeneration become a thing as well. (The post I made about the human trials starting this month in Japan gives me hope about the former of those two). Along with that, I'd love to see the ability to grow human organs for people using their own DNA, thus making most risk of the body rejecting it negated.\n\nAs someone who suffers from tinnitus, I'm hoping I'll see a permanent cure or remedy come to pass in my life. Quantum Computing and DNA data storage are something I would absolutely love to see as well, as they've always fascinated me. I'd love to see space travel expanded, including finally sending astronauts to Mars like I constantly saw in science fiction growing up. Synthetic fuels that have very little to no carbon emissions that can power internal combustion engines are a big one, as I'd like a way to still own and drive classic cars, even if conventional gasoline ends up being banned, without converting it to electric power. And while I am cautious about artificial intelligence and making humanlike AI companions, at the same time, I also would like to see them. The idea of something I couldn't tell the difference from a regular human is fascinating, to reuse the word.\n\nBut my ultimate hope, my white unicorn of things I want, desperately so, to live to see, is, of course, life extension and physical age reversal. This is simply because, at my age, I already know just 70-100 years of life is not enough for me, and there are far, far too many things I want to do, that will take more than a single natural lifetime to accomplish. And many will require me to have a youthful physical body in order to do so. So that is the Big Kahuna for me. The one above all others I literally pray every night I'll live to see.\n\nBut those are a few of the things I hope I'll live to see come to pass. Now it's your turn. In terms of medicine and technology, what are you hoping you'll live to see? I'm curious to hear your answers!",

If you haven't kept up with it, this article should get you up to speed:   https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a60952102/tooth-regrowth-human-trials-japan/\n\nThe fact we may be just a little over half a decade away from eradicating toothlessness, where anyone who loses theirs for any reason can get them back is a massive leap forward in medicine. And it makes me wonder what the next big leaps are going to be in the pipeline. Which is why I wanted to ask you and get a discussion going on this. What do you think, either from speculation or from following along more closely than I have, do you think will be the next big leaps forward when it comes to medicine? What are the next big revolutions going to be over the course of the next ten years or so?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

Currently, there is an agreement with NASA, which I do not know much about -I work in another area-, but I have heard about it in lunches. Basically, they share data about expeditions, specifically about soil conditions, atmospheric pressure, composition and other variables necessary to think about how potatoes could be planted on a planet other than Earth. It's wonderful. But it also makes me think about how to coordinate not only at an international level, but also thinking about frontiers beyond. What is the future of food? It is known that the effect of climate change is irreversible, and that time has run out to reach a consensus on mitigation strategies. So, the only way out in the medium and/or long term is to migrate to another planet? It is something that is already known, it is taken for granted, although not publicly? ",

You have people who stand out as individuals, someone may dress very prep, or very goth, or very \"athlete\", but they are standing out as individuals not as some sort of fashion or subculture. Rather, people tend to dress relatively the same.\n\nI will say, probably the only identifiable subculture I see is when I go into the really wealthy side of the city, where you see sundresses, polos, kind of gold style clothes. That actually stands out as a clear fashion trend. I also think the Patrick Mahomes looking curly hair style is a set trend, but even then that's more of an overall trend rather than a subculture trend... athletes/artists/regular boys alike are sort of adopting that style. But beyond that, there seems to not really be overriding fashion trends. \n\nNow, the argument against myself here is... these subcultures/trends are really the ones that we remember. What was the average teenager wearing in the 90s? 80s? I couldn't really tell you. ",

It was forced on her by an abusive ex who did it himself (he was a tattoo \u201cartist \u201c)\n\nIt is a huge piece of botched green tribal art. She has had five course of laser removal and it is still very visible. She\u2019s exploring options for getting it covered now that she\u2019s had the lasering.\n\nI was wondering if there were any near term (5-20 yr timeframe) technologies that looked more promising than laser removal for tattoos. Does anyone know of any research?",

        "created_utc": 1724983591.0,
        "selftext": "There is a lot of sci-fi content focusing on the idea of colonizing other planets. Correct me if I'm wrong, but won't that be impossible with the limitations of the human organism? Even if we had the technology to travel to other planets?  \n  \n The issue and the reason I'm asking this question for discussion. Is how we humans seem to be hopelessly dependent on our own biosphere. It's not just that we need water and oxygen. We need to be exposed to bacteria for our immune system? And nutrients from our biosphere?  \n  \n Humans are basically enslaved to earth through the symbiotic relationship between us and nature. Our bodies needs our biosphere to survive.   \n  \n So from a biological standpoint can terraforming ever be a realistic notion without us becoming cyborgs? By cyborgs I mean artificial organs, limbs, blood etc. to the point we are \"brains in jars\". As the human body is simply too fragile and dependent on the organic life around us to survive.  \n  \n It's a depressing thought I've had many times so figured I'd ask here. Because it seems to me that organic life on earth, including us humans, are hopelessly dependent on other organical life. Our ecosystems, biosphere, and nature itself - to live.  \n  \n Maybe this is one of the answers to the fermi paradox? Sentient life that evolves are trapped in the living conditions of the planets they evolved in.",

        "selftext": "I recently came across some [thought-provoking insights from a space investor](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1915816/15656030) about the current state and future of the European space sector. These points raise interesting questions about where we're headed in space exploration and commercialization:\n\n1. Europe's launcher industry is facing challenges in competing with reusable rockets. How might this affect Europe's future role in space?\n2. There's a growing need for technologies that can enhance satellite resilience and maneuverability due to increasing space debris. How could this shape future satellite designs and space traffic management?\n3. Asteroid mining is still considered decades away, but some companies are developing step-by-step approaches. What potential impacts could this have on future space economies and resource management?\n4. The concept of becoming an interplanetary species raises complex questions about human reproduction and adaptation in different gravitational environments. How might this influence long-term space colonization efforts?\n5. There's ongoing debate about who should shape our future in space - politicians, space agencies, billionaires, or the general public. How might different stakeholders' involvement affect the direction of space exploration and commercialization?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these topics? How do you envision the European space sector evolving over the next 20-30 years in light of these challenges and opportunities?",

I haven't really been following things... but I've heard Goodman is on Ozempic (along with a lot of Hollywood) and the difference is rather amazing. And I know quite a few people who are taking Ozempic (my parents included) and really... it sort of feels like a miracle drug.\n\nAnd I know there has been all sorts of hairloss treatments for men... but my friend got back from a long trip to Turkey. For as long as I've known him, he has had the hairline and thinning hair of a 50 year old man, even when he was in college. But he came back, with basically Timothee Chalamet hair. I know there are variety of treatments, from topical stuff to full transplanets to ultra realistic toupees.\n\nIt's just kind of interesting these miracle treatments happened so quietly. I also feel there are things where a lot of people are using them but we don't know. Nobody is going to say \"I've been taking anti-hair thinning treatment for five years now\" or \"I'm on weight loss medication!\" So, they kind of go by under the radar. ",

        "created_utc": 1724567191.0,
        "selftext": "In this forum I see a lot of posts about this topic so I thought I might get some answers. When confronted with this problem, one often hears responses along the lines of\n\n* expensive to raise children.--> however, we see a decline rate worldwide and also lower compared to some previous centuries after 1700 where the quality of living was much worse.\n* various environmental problems such as climate change are impacted by more fossil fuel use.-->that is likely part of the motivation, but we will need young people to discover technologies that reduce our fossil-fuel dependence.\n\nI was wondering if it is actually driven by culture. As the standard of living improves and we are able to focus more on our careers, do we see less value in raising kids? Have we started to see it as more of a chore?\n\nAlso, Doepke talks about the disparity in pay between men and women who have children [The New Economics of Fertility (imf.org)](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Analytical-Series/new-economics-of-fertility-doepke-hannusch-kindermann-tertilt). It was observed that the very ultra-low-fertility countries like Japan and Korea had an expectation on women doing the brunt of the work (80%). Whereas countries with low-fertility rate, the workload split was more even. \n\nSo it could be that we are just in a transition period where more and more men are realizing that they need to split the work of raising children.",

        "selftext": "For thousands of years humans have looked to a future where things get better for the majority, and yet it never does; science and technology improves, education spreads, productivity improves, resources abound, and yet ever more do the horrible wars continue \u2013 with the senseless slaughter of scores of civilians including children \u2013 unabated since time immemorial, poverty endemic, access to healthcare, housing and more continues to elude many, even in countries like the U.S. which have the highest concentrations of wealth among individuals; all sorts of problems persist, same as millennia ago, as if things never changed.\n\nRight now, even with remarkable advancements in science and technology unfolding before our eyes, it fills many, not with hope, but with despair and fear of a more marginalised and economically frustrating future; how is it possible, that advancements should rather (and ever it does) bring people worry and not hope?\n\nIt is because we are failing to pay attention to, and fix, the areas really needed and responsible for helping us build better societies; ***governance*** and ***development planning***.\n\nWhenever we think of solving society's problems, we think in terms of ***technology*** and, then, ***economics***, but ***economics*** especially does not concern itself so much with solving as it does with studying and analyzing.\n\nFields like\u00a0***governance***\u00a0and\u00a0***development planning***\u00a0are where real development and management of society occurs. They are also responsible for directing and harmonizing advancements and understanding or expertise in various other fields (from science and technology to psychology, education and more) to this end; i.e. improving society.\n\nYet, as other fields like the sciences continue to advance at an astonishing pace, ***governance and politics*** in particular remain pretty much in the stone age; in spite of all the scholarship in those fields, our (or at least the majority's, including most authorities') understanding of it remains rudimentary at best \u2013 [heavily flawed with bad conceptualisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeSEx7veNKI) on basic concepts \u2013 built on the wrong foundations; a problem not too uncommon in the humanities and social sciences in general, and which it's scholars will not own up to. Without proper systems for governance in place, ***planning*** also suffers.\n\nSo, we are never able to apply our successes and expertise in science and technology, psychology etc. to create change for the majority in society, because the vehicle through which we will do this (i.e. governance) is mostly broken; and has been broken for thousands of years; we don't know this, because we change its colors or looks and think we have changed the vehicle itself.\n\n* If we will properly ***solve poverty***, it sounds like an issue of economics, but it's actually a problem of governance and planning; economics just offers the analyses or science for understanding phenomena in there.\n* If we will ***develop education, healthcare delivery, better social interaction etc.***, we can't leave that to technology. Governance and planning brings the relevant expertise together, and channels them sensibly to solving and managing human problems and society.\n* If we will ***solve wars***, we can't leave that to technology or economics; it's a problem of governance.\n\nIt takes all of us recognizing this, to take steps to fix governance, which will in turn fix politics and planning alongside that, to then help bring everything together.",

There's a few different kinds I've seen, be it the groups who think it'll either not happen in our lifetimes, or not at all, groups who think only the super rich will be able to use it and it never reach even the upper middle class, let allow the lower classes, and even a few groups who seem to think that taking away death as an inevitability is wrong somehow, that it makes life meaningless for whatever reason. I know there is a difference between pessimism and trying to remain realistic, but I don't think I can wrap my head around it personally. \n\nIn terms of it coming, where things we once thought impossible like the ability to naturally regrow human teeth or create a vaccine for lung cancer are now within our grasp and clinical trials are being run, it makes me unable to see why it won't be reachable soon, especially with the growing number of scientists and other individuals seeming to agree that we're not as far off from it as the majority of people may think.\n\nSo, could you please enlighten me as to why so many on here seem to have this view of it?

It was written in spreadsheet form, where the left hand column was the time frame, and the right hand was what the person was experiencing.\n\nThere were some parameters set up in the beginning where the person was assigned and island or planet of some sort, and was given companions for sex or intimacy. As the years go on, he eventually goes mad, and then resorts to going into a catatonic state for thousands of years.

After dealing with the heartbreak of losing biobanks due to human error and fragile setups in places like Hawaii, she\u2019s come up with a failsafe plan: a biobank near the lunar South Pole. Why there? Because the temperature naturally hangs around that of liquid nitrogen, making it perfect for storing biomaterial. It\u2019s like nature\u2019s own deep freezer, just 238,855 miles away.\n\nImagine this: a backup of our planet\u2019s entire biodiversity, safely tucked away on the moon, far from human reach, ready to help us out if things go sideways here on Earth. It\u2019s not just science fiction; it\u2019s a visionary step toward future-proofing life as we know it.\n\nIn case you're curious to hear more about this mind-blowing idea. Mary breaks it all down in the latest episode of the Space Caf\u00e9 Podcast.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [\\[Link to Episode\\]](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1915816/15575607)\n\nWhat do you think?

        "created_utc": 1723693012.0,
        "selftext": "For me it's just being so used to very dim computer screens, that you really need to be enclosed in a dark office space to use your screen and not have eye strain. Very bright screens are so friggin expensive and totally not the norm. Even using a phone or laptop outside on a nice sunny day is totally unbearable. We are not vampires  - how can this be normal?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nedit @ 23hrs:\n\n(Note about E-Ink below - lets get it happening people!)\n\nThis post seems to have quite a bit of attention which is great! Lots of nice ideas - mostly pretty optimistic except for some scary climate change related concerns. Hopefully these don't turn out as bad as some of us fear.\n\nSome of the few highlights I took away (although some of these might be too optimistic for the 20 years time-frame):\n\n- Medicine and in particular chemotherapy hopefully will improve or become obsolete with better treatments\n\n- Genomic sequencing tech - hopefully will get better and cheaper bringing medical advances\n\n- Plastics - hopefully we find a way to end use of this toxic stuff\n\n- Wired charging and cords everywhere -wireless future hopefully?\n\n- Treatment of animals / factory farming\n\n- Politics stuff\n\n- Driving cars\n\n- Working insane hours for little pay\n\n----------------------------\n\nThe example I gave about the screens being hard to use in daylight seems to have been surprisingly controversial. I took it for granted that most screens are hard on your eyes in full sunlight. Yet many people seem to think this isn't an issue at all. Maybe worth noting: I do not have any problem with my eyes or turning up brightness on my devices. The problem is very obvious when comparing a Dell monitor (model P2319H: made in Nov 2021) with my Macbook Air (2024). The Dell (250 nits brightness) is virtually useless in my current office with an unusually large north-facing window. The macbook is not bad (500 nits brightness), but still crap under full sun. Keep in mind I am from a city with a lot of sunlight (Perth Australia).\n\nThree take aways from this: \n\n-\tA lot of you guys either live near the north pole, or just dont go outside very much. Seriously try and use your devices to do some reading on a nice sunny morning sitting outside for a while and see how hard it is with glare and reflection. Devices are getting better but I dont think it's as good as you think it is.\n\n-\tA lot of people dont know about e-ink technology / front-lit screen as opposed to back-lit displays. I hope this tech booms in the next decade or two.\n\n-\tLastly - the sun is actually good for you! Just dont overdo it. Be brave and go outside sometimes. To quote Andrew Huberman \"Getting sunlight in your eyes is crucial, and doing so through a window is about 50 times less effective than being outside without any barriers such as windows or sunglasses. This is because glass windows filter out certain wavelengths of light that are important for setting circadian rhythms.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\n\nCheers from Perth!\n\n",
